This branch contains additional stuff that is only useful on Windows

My collection of dotfiles

> [!NOTE]
> The `~` or `$HOME` is used to denote your home directory. On Windows this will typically be at `C:\Users\[YOUR_USERNAME]\`. On Linux this will typically be at `/home/[YOUR_USERNAME]/`.

> [!WARNING]
> Some parts of these files and scripts may expect the repo to be cloned to `~/.dotfiles`. Cloning it anywhere else could lead to some stuff not working as expected.

This repo is setup with [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/#intro), so to ensure hooks are correctly set up, you should execute `pre-commit install`.
