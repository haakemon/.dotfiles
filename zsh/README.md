# [ZSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)

> [!WARNING]
> The `_setup.sh` script currently expects [`apt`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)) package manager to be available on your system.

Prepare the terminal, by installing a nerd font (https://www.nerdfonts.com/), f.ex `MesloLGM Nerd Font Mono` and set the terminal to use that. Font size 12 usually works pretty well.

Execute `_setup.sh` to install homebrew and some packages, and setup zsh.
